Greetings , 
I have made a 1:200 scale model of USS NIMITZ a Nuclear Aircraft Carrier.
I have used ardunnio and esp32 for working of the warship.
ESP32 is used for bluetooth connnectivity and direction control
While ardunio uno is used for controlling the servo motor and ultrasonic sensors.
I have used mpu6050 sensor for gyroscope for self balancing of the aircraft carrier.

I have provided the code and 3D sketch , Do check out th gyroscope repository to get better understanding of self balencing momentum wheel.
